# Data science - Candidate testing

### Detect total amount TTC on receipt document with Computer Vision approach
We invite you first to look at our website to learn more about our company youngapp.co

### Importants points:
- Follow deep learning approach for detect total amount TTC on receipt document
- Write your notebooks on Google Colab in Python
- Use CNN, RCNN, Fast-RCNN, or Faster-RCNN deep learning algorithm
- Use tensorflow, keras, numpy or pytorch (pytorch recommanded) 
- Document your code with markdown, step per step.

### Datasets:
The link of receipts datasets (200):
- https://expressexpense.com/blog/free-receipt-images-ocr-machine-learning-dataset/
- https://github.com/clovaai/cord

### Result:
The documentation is always in English with us!
If the test is conclusive, we will see later for a second interview with the CTO.

##### To return **the google colab**
