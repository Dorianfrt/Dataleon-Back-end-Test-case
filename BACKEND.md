# Backend Candidate testing
Back-end - testing cases

I invite you first to look at our website to learn more about our company youngapp.co

The idea:
- Create a NodeJS / TypeScript OOP class to retrieve intent from the Machine Learning LUIS engine
- Make sure to write the TypeScript test
- Make sure to write the tests with mochajs and SinonJS for function mocking
- I introduced an example in the documentation

https://docs.microsoft.com/bs-cyrl-ba/azure///cognitive-services/luis/luis-get-started-node-get-intent

You can use it to make the request. the documentation is always in English with us!
If the test is conclusive, we will see later for a second interview with the CTO.

To return for the end of the week
Best regards
